# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday Class

# If-Else Practice Activity

## Building a Calculator
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers(floats preferrably) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform

# Lists
Collection of values stored in a list
It is a composite data type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable
Each piece is called an element

# Loops
Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a <strong>certain condition is met.</strong>

DRY coding principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

'If' condition would decide whether or not to run the indented block, whereas...
Loops will decide how many times the user wants to run the indented block

# While Loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the indented block. If not met, skip the block.

Things to consider:
    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop
